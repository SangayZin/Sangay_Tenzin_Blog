## Topic: Introduction to Database Systems

In this unit, we've looked into the theoretical foundations of database systems, and the basic concepts for dealing or interacting with data in a way that makes it useful and easy to find. Many applications, including web services and enterprise software, depend heavily on database systems for structure and way to organize data in a form that they can be accessed easily. This unit position with the fundamental of what databases are, how they coordinate with software and which languages are used in order to interact with them within that aspect. This, in fact, touches on various topics like the presentation of data, database languages, and database-system architecture that enables smooth running of applications.

## Key Takeaways:
### 1. Data, Database, and Database System:

- Data - Collection of facts.

- Database - A database is an organized collection of
  structured information, or data, typically stored
  electronically in a computer system.

- Database Management System - is a collection of
  interrelated data and a set of programs to access those
  data.

### 2. Purpose of Database Systems:

The database systems serve the purpose of organizing, storing, and retrieving data efficiently while making the data accessible and secure and allowing scalability.

### 3. Use of Database System Applications in Various Industries:

We understood how industries are using database systems for managing and processing their data. In the finance and banking, health, e-commerce, and social media industries, databases have become the backbone of every function in the enterprises, thus aiding organizations in storing customer data, maintaining transaction records, and ensuring service delivery.

### 4. Evolution of Database Systems:

The database systems have seen drastic changes in their modes of construction throughout the years. Early database systems were simpler, based on file storage. Today, we possess relational databases, NoSQL databases, and distributed databases capable of processing information on an enormous scale and enabling modern applications.

### 5.Different Types of Data Models:

We learned about various data models like Entity-Relationship Model, Semi-structured Data Model, Object-Based Data Model, and Relational Model. Different types of Databases or database models are there, which organizes and represents the data differently and helps in structuring database effectively.

#### Entity-Relationship Data Model

*Entity-Relationship Data Model – Visual representation of entities and their relationships in a database.*

#### Semi-structured Data Model

*Illustration of Semi-structured Data Model – Flexible data organization for varying structures.*

#### Relational Data Model

*Diagram of Relational Data Model – Organizing data into structured tables with defined relationships.*

#### Object-Based Data Model

*Object-Based Data Model – Structuring databases with objects to align with object-oriented programming principles.*



### 6.Database Languages and Their Applications:

We learned about  two essential types of database languages;  Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML). DDL is used to define and manage the structure of the database, whereas DML is used to manipulate and retrieve data from the database.

### 7.Database System Architecture and Components:

The architecture of a database system includes components like the storage manager, query processor, and transaction management. These components work together to store data, process user queries, and ensure safe and efficient data transactions.

#### Two-tier and Three-tier Architectures

*Two-tier and Three-tier database architectures – demonstrating separation of layers for efficiency and scalability.*


#### Database System Architecture

*An overview of database system architecture – components involved in efficient data management.*

### 8.Types of Database Users and Their Roles:

We learned the different types of database users including end-users who use an application to view the data, and Database Administrators (DBA) -- end-users who manage the database, their roles include maintaining data security, backups, and ensuring performance of the database.

### 9.Key Responsibilities of Database Administrators:

The DBA plays a key role in managing and maintaining the database system. Their roles are to manage the data security, ensure the performance of the database, and handle the backup and recovery processes to safeguard the data.

### What I learned and Why it Matters:

In this very first unit, database systems, types of data models, database languages, architecture was taught. Learning the difference between databases and DBMS helped me understand the workflows of storing, accessing, and communicating with data more efficiently within applications in modern applications.

One of the most important lessons was database design. Selecting the proper data model is crucial once you consider that it defines how the data is built and accessed. I also understood a little bit about how database engines take care of the backend of managing data, this is helpful to applications that need access to the data in real time.

 This knowledge matter because almost all software today sits on top of a database. From an e-commerce application processing customer orders to a social media app processing user profiles, databases are essential to be able to store and retrieve large amounts of data accurately and quickly. Knowing how databases work and how to design them well will help you build performant and scalable systems in the future.

###  Personal Growth and Reflection

Before starting on this unit, my general understanding of databases was superficial. I knew they stored data, but I was ignorant of the great complexities involved in organizing, managing, and retrieving that data efficiently. The knowledge obtained on data modeling and its applicability to the structure of databases made it clear to me that there are many options open to take, based on the wants of the application.

I also have increased my awareness of the way the DBMS works with relation to data integrity, security, and performance. I feel much more adept in my ability to comprehend abstract concepts as they were sharpened with practical applications presented to us during in-class examples.
