## Topic: Introduction to Database Systems
In this Unit, we covered the core concepts of database systems, which are fundamental for implementing and accessing data in a manner that makes it useful and easy to find. Many applications including web services and enterprise software rely heavily on database systems to provide structure and otherwise organize data in a manner that is easily accessible. This unit provided a base knowledge of what the databases are, how they work with the software and the languages with which we are able to interact with them.
Through various topics such as the view of data, database languages, and the architecture of database systems, we explored how databases facilitate the smooth operation of applications. 

## Key Takeaways:
### 1. Data, Database, and Database System:

- Data - Collection of facts.

- Database - A database is an organized collection of
  structured information, or data, typically stored
  electronically in a computer system.

- Database Management System - is a collection of
  interrelated data and a set of programs to access those
  data.

### 2. Purpose of Database Systems:

we understood that Database systems are designed to organize, store, and retrieve data efficiently, ensuring accessibility, security, and scalability.

### 3. Use of Database System Applications in Various Industries:

We explored how different industries rely on database systems to manage and process data. In industries like banking, healthcare, e-commerce, and social media, databases are integral to daily operations, helping businesses store customer data, manage transactions, and deliver services effectively.

### 4. Evolution of Database Systems:

Database systems have evolved significantly over the years. Early systems were simple file-based storage, but now we have relational databases, NoSQL databases, and distributed databases capable of handling massive amounts of data and supporting modern applications.

### 5.Different Types of Data Models:

We learned about various data models like Entity-Relationship Model, Semi-structured Data Model, Object-Based Data Model, and Relational Model. Different types of Databases or database models are there, which organizes and represents the data differently and helps in structuring database effectively.

#### Entity-Relationship Data Model

*Entity-Relationship Data Model – Visual representation of entities and their relationships in a database.*

#### Semi-structured Data Model

*Illustration of Semi-structured Data Model – Flexible data organization for varying structures.*

#### Relational Data Model

*Diagram of Relational Data Model – Organizing data into structured tables with defined relationships.*

#### Object-Based Data Model

*Object-Based Data Model – Structuring databases with objects to align with object-oriented programming principles.*



### 6.Database Languages and Their Applications:

We learned about  two essential types of database languages;  Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML). DDL is used to define and manage the structure of the database, whereas DML is used to manipulate and retrieve data from the database.

### 7.Database System Architecture and Components:

The architecture of a database system includes components like the storage manager, query processor, and transaction management. These components work together to store data, process user queries, and ensure safe and efficient data transactions.

#### Two-tier and Three-tier Architectures

*Two-tier and Three-tier database architectures – demonstrating separation of layers for efficiency and scalability.*


#### Database System Architecture

*An overview of database system architecture – components involved in efficient data management.*

### 8.Types of Database Users and Their Roles:

We learned the different types of database users including end-users who use an application to view the data, and Database Administrators (DBA) -- end-users who manage the database, their roles include maintaining data security, backups, and ensuring performance of the database.

### 9.Key Responsibilities of Database Administrators:

The DBA plays a key role in managing and maintaining the database system. Their roles are to manage the data security, ensure the performance of the database, and handle the backup and recovery processes to safeguard the data.

### What I learned and Why it Matters:

In this very first unit, database systems, types of data models, database languages, architecture was taught. Learning the difference between databases and DBMS helped me understand the workflows of storing, accessing, and communicating with data more efficiently within applications in modern applications.

One of the most important lessons was database design. Selecting the proper data model is crucial once you consider that it defines how the data is built and accessed. I also understood a little bit about how database engines take care of the backend of managing data, this is helpful to applications that need access to the data in real time.

 This knowledge matter because almost all software today sits on top of a database. From an e-commerce application processing customer orders to a social media app processing user profiles, databases are essential to be able to store and retrieve large amounts of data accurately and quickly. Knowing how databases work and how to design them well will help you build performant and scalable systems in the future.
