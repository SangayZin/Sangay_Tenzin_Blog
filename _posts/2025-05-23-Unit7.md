## Topic: Database Systems Fundamentals

### Introduction

Coming into Unit 7, I had a basic understanding of how databases worked—mostly around data storage, retrieval, and simple queries. However, I had little awareness of what happens behind the scenes when multiple users interact with a database at the same time or when a system fails. This unit opened my eyes to the inner workings of reliable and consistent database systems, focusing on how transactions are managed, how concurrency is controlled, and how systems recover from failures. It was a technically challenging but rewarding unit that gave me a deeper appreciation for database systems as a whole.



###  Key Takeaways;

### 1. Database Transactions & ACID Properties

One of the biggest takeaways for me was learning how important transactions are for maintaining data integrity. A transaction isn’t just a single query it can be a group of operations that must all succeed or fail together.

I now understand how the ACID properties ensure reliable transactions:

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is either fully completed or fully rolled back.

Consistency guarantees that a database moves from one valid state to another.

Isolation controls how transaction effects are visible to others, preventing interference.

Durability makes sure that once a transaction is committed, it won’t be lost—even if the system crashes.

I also found it useful to understand how transactions are modeled and implemented, especially through examples like simple bank transfers or inventory updates.

This diagram helped me visualize how a transaction progresses through different states: Active → Partially Committed → Committed or Failed → Aborted. It showed how databases track transaction behavior and when a rollback is necessary. It reinforced the importance of atomicity and durability, especially when something goes wrong during execution.


### 2. Concurrency Control & Locking Mechanisms

This part of the unit really changed the way I think about databases in multi-user environments. Before this, I didn’t fully appreciate the risks of multiple users modifying the same data at the same time.

I learned why locks are essential and how they prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions.

Concepts like Two-Phase Locking (2PL), lock escalation, and intention locks helped me see how databases balance concurrency and safety.

We also explored how deadlocks can occur, and I understood how systems detect and resolve them using techniques like victim selection and rollback strategies.

The class demo on locks was especially helpful—it made abstract ideas like isolation levels much easier to understand.

This diagram illustrated how locks can be applied at different granular levels, like database, table, page, and record. It explained why finer lock granularity increases concurrency but may involve more overhead.

This simple yet powerful diagram showed how intention locks allow a system to know what level of lock is needed on a resource. It made the concept of intention shared (IS) and intention exclusive (IX) much clearer.

This diagram visualized how a wait-for graph can be used to detect deadlocks. By identifying cycles in the graph, the system knows a deadlock has occurred and can take steps to resolve it.

This showed different strategies like wait-die and wound-wait, which are proactive techniques used to avoid entering a deadlock state. The visual comparison between these approaches made the trade-offs easier to understand.

### 3. Database Recovery & Logging

This section gave me a whole new perspective on what happens when things go wrong—like system crashes or power failures.

I learned how database logs play a vital role in recording all changes, which can be used for both undo and redo operations.

The concept of checkpoints, especially fuzzy checkpoints, was new to me and showed how performance and recovery need to be balanced.

We discussed how modern systems use advanced recovery algorithms like ARIES to ensure that the database can always return to a consistent state after failure.

I was also introduced to main-memory databases and how their recovery methods differ due to their volatility.

### What I Learned and Why It Matters

Before this unit, I didn’t think much about what could go wrong inside a database system. But now, I realize that even the smallest failure—like a system crash or overlapping queries—can lead to data corruption if not properly managed.

Some important lessons:

- ACID properties are the foundation of reliable databases. Without them, we risk inconsistencies.

- Locks and deadlock prevention are vital when many users interact with the system simultaneously.

- Recovery systems ensure that data is never permanently lost, which is crucial for high-stakes applications.

- This knowledge matters because it helps me design and use more robust and resilient database systems in the future. It also prepares me for real-world situations where data integrity is non-negotiable.

### Personal Growth and Reflection

Reflecting on my earlier understanding, I used to view databases mostly from the front-end or user-level perspective—just storing and retrieving information. This unit has expanded that view significantly.

Now, I think more like a systems thinker—someone who understands not just what the database does, but how and why it behaves the way it does in different scenarios. The lock demo we did in class made these abstract concepts come alive, and it was one of my favorite parts of the unit.

Overall, I’ve grown both in technical knowledge and in confidence. I now feel better equipped to deal with more complex database concepts and systems.

### Conclusion

Unit 7 has been a turning point in my understanding of databases. It took me from a surface-level understanding to a much deeper appreciation of what makes databases reliable, consistent, and safe even in the face of failure or concurrency. Whether it's handling transactions, implementing locks, or recovering from crashes, I now understand how these mechanisms form the backbone of modern database systems.

I'm excited to apply this knowledge in future projects and explore more advanced topics in database design and implementation. This unit has truly enhanced my perspective and prepared me for more advanced challenges in the field.
