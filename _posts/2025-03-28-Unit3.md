## Topic: Database Systems Fundamentals

### Introduction

In this Unit, we explored fundamental concepts that help us efficiently manage and manipulate databases. We covered topics such as ACID properties, SQL syntax, writing queries, handling NULL values, and performing set operations. These concepts have provided a deeper understanding of how databases function and how to use SQL effectively. Below are the key takeaways from this unit, along with reflections on personal growth and learning.

### Key Takeaways;

### 1.Understanding ACID Properties in Databases

One of the most crucial aspects of database management is maintaining reliability and consistency. This is where the ACID properties—Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability—play a vital role. These properties ensure that database transactions are processed securely and accurately, even in cases of system failures. Learning about ACID has enhanced my understanding of how databases maintain integrity and prevent data corruption.

The diagram visually represents the four ACID properties—Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It highlights how these principles work together to maintain data integrity in database transactions. 

### 2.SQL as a Standard Language for RDBMS

SQL is the universal language for managing relational databases. It provides the means to create, retrieve, update, and delete data. Before this unit, I only had a basic idea of SQL, but now I understand its structure, syntax, and importance in database management.

### 3.Basic Structure of SQL

SQL consists of various commands categorized into different types:

Data Definition Language (DDL): Commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP to define and modify database structures.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): Commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for handling data.

Data Control Language (DCL) and Transaction Control Language (TCL): These include GRANT, REVOKE, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK to manage user permissions and transactions.

Understanding these categories has helped me write more structured and effective SQL queries.

### 4.Writing SQL Queries for Basic Operations

Before this unit, I was unfamiliar with writing actual SQL queries. Now, I can retrieve data from tables using SELECT statements, insert new records, update existing ones, and delete unnecessary data. This hands-on experience has improved my confidence in working with databases.

### 5.Performing Set Operations in SQL

Set operations such as UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT help combine or filter results from multiple queries, improving data handling efficiency. Understanding these operations allows me to refine data queries and perform more advanced data manipulations.

### 6.Understanding NULL Values in SQL

NULL values in SQL represent missing or unknown data. Handling NULL values correctly using functions like COALESCE and IS NULL is critical to ensuring accurate query results. This concept helped me avoid incorrect calculations in queries that involve aggregate functions.

### 7.Using Aggregate Functions in SQL

Aggregate functions, including COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN, allow us to perform calculations on data sets, making them useful for summarizing large amounts of information. Learning these functions has made it easier to analyze and extract meaningful insights from data.

### 8.Writing Nested Subqueries

Subqueries help in executing complex queries by embedding one query within another. They are useful for filtering data, retrieving specific information, and breaking down complex logic. Before this unit, I found SQL queries overwhelming, but now I can confidently write nested queries for efficient data retrieval.

The diagram illustrates how a nested subquery works by retrieving office codes for employees located in the USA before selecting specific employee details.

### 9.Modifying Databases Using SQL

Modifying databases using SQL has helped me understand how to alter table structures, update records, and manage constraints effectively. I have learned how to safely modify data while ensuring database integrity and security. This knowledge is essential for anyone working with databases, including administrators and developers, and I can see how valuable it is in real-world applications.

### Personal Growth and Reflection

Before studying this unit, I had a limited understanding of databases and SQL. I used to think databases were just storage systems, but now I realize their complexity and the importance of structuring data efficiently. Writing SQL queries has helped me develop problem-solving skills and logical thinking.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was understanding complex queries, but with practice, I have improved. I also enjoyed working with real SQL exercises, as they provided hands-on experience in database management.

### Conclusion

Unit 3 provided a strong foundation in SQL, from understanding ACID properties to writing complex queries. By mastering these concepts, we can efficiently manage and manipulate relational databases, ensuring data integrity and reliability in real-world applications.
